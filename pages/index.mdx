In physical scenarios with shared resources (such as restaurants, libraries, gyms, etc.), the occupancy and congestion 
of facilities information can provide great convenience for users and guests. Existing crowd counting algorithms mostly
deal with the total number of people in a video rather than the details. However, they provide insights of how to track the 
overall counting though the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and image processing techniques [1]. These methods make 
it possible to observe crowd dynamics in real time. We are interested in crowd counting through the use of CV because of the 
lackluster real-time occupancy report currently provided by UW-Madisonâ€™s gyms. The traditional gym methods face challenges 
such as inability to track real-time occupancy and headcount across different areas with only manual 
counting, hindering resource allocation and impacting user experience[2]. This
information is crucial for users seeking to optimize their workout routines and
avoid crowded areas or wait times for specific equipment.
We develop a system that utilizes machine learning and traditional
computer vision techniques to provide real-time occupancy statistics
and headcount for different floors and specific areas within a gym, while ensuring user privacy.

Our objectives and goals are the following:
1. Develop and evaluate baseline for direct head-counting given images
2. Develop and evaluate baseline for indirect people-counting given images
3. Develop and evaluate deep learning methods for crowd counting given
images
4. Apply above techniques on custom, privacy-ensured dataset collected from
the gym
