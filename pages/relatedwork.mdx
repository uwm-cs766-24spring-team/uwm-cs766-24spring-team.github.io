There are many approaches to computer vision (CV) crowd counting. Although vision-based approaches from image/video data is a very natural method-
ology, in a building environment such as a gym, there are many ingenious methods to accurately determine how busy each floor is.

## Tracking with AP Points
The use of sensors that scan for radio signals (Bluetooth and WiFi) in an area is employed in many university libraries, which
can quickly and accurately assess floor occupancy [7]. But Wi-Fi-based
estimates provide only a general overview of gym occupancy without offering insights into specific areas or different types of equipment usage.

## Crowd Counting using Traditional Methods 
Classical CV approaches to crowd counting primarily rely on using video data captured from a surveillance 
camera or other visual sensor. These sensors then uses various techniques to detect and count individuals.In early works, crowd counting
work by detecting individual with bounding boxes. This is accurate in low
density crowds. However, in overcrowded scene with severe occlusions, it
is not optimal to detect every single person [8, 9].

## Convolutions Neural Networks
More recently, convolutions neural networks
(CNNs) have become popular in vision-based crowd counting. Due to the
common visual features of people in a crowd, CNNs can use this prior
effectively to accurately understand a scene, such as [10, 11, 3].
