There are many approaches to computer vision (CV) crowd counting.  Al-  
though vision-based approaches from image/video data is a very natural method-  
ology, in a building environment such as a gym, there are many ingenious meth-  
ods to accurately determine how busy each floor is.  

Tracking with AP Points  The use of sensors that scan for radio signals (Blue-  
tooth and WiFi) in an area is employed in many university libraries, which  
can quickly and accurately assess floor occupancy [7].  But Wi-Fi-based  
estimates provide only a general overview of gym occupancy without of-  
fering insights into specific areas or different types of equipment usage.  
Crowd Counting using Traditional Methods  Classical CV approaches to  
crowd counting primarily rely on using video data captured from a surveil-  
lance camera or other visual sensor. These sensors then uses various tech-  
niques to detect and count individuals.  In early works, crowd counting  
work by detecting individual with bounding boxes. This is accurate in low  
density crowds. However, in overcrowded scene with severe occlusions, it  
is not optimal to detect every single person [8, 9].  

Convolutions Neural Networks  More recently, convolutions neural networks  
(CNNs) have become popular in vision-based crowd counting. Due to the  
common visual features of people in a crowd, CNNs can use this prior  
effectively to accurately understand a scene, such as [10, 11, 3].
